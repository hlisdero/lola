Usually, all you have to do is just a plain

    ./configure
    make

This will leave an executable kc++ in the top directory of the distribution.
Since this is really all you need, there is no 'make install' and such. Just
copy the file to a convenient location.

If you don't want to run configure, edit the Makefile.in by hand; right now
it's only used for the version number.

There is also documentation in two places. In the directory 'man' you'll find
a man page with an ultra-short description of how to invoke kc++, the Kimwitu++
'compiler.' More documentation is in the doc directory, in LaTeX format. Do

    cd doc
    make

to obtain a printable version (this is not yet 'implemented').

More info in the README file.
