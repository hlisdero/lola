"""
This program parses the verbose bison output in order to extract the states
and their corresponding rules. For example, the snippet
state 328

  303 ac_declarator: ac_pointer ac_direct_declarator .
  314 ac_direct_declarator: ac_direct_declarator . '[' ac_constant_expression_option ']'
  315                     | ac_direct_declarator . '(' ac_parameter_type_list ')'

is translated to two C arrays 

int error_rules[][2], error_state[];

These arrays, can be used for error reporting in the generated bison parser.
Using the arrays yyrhs and yyr1, the complete text of a rule can be
reproduced. The only missing information is the association between (state,
(rule number, position of the dot)); it is provided by the aforementioned
arrays.

error_state gives, for a state, the index into error_rules, which,
starting at that index and terminated by {0,0} provides all rule
numbers and dot positions.

This program is invoked with the name of the bison output foo.output.
It then generates a file foo-output.c

The following assumptions are made about the input:
- the individual state listings start at column 0 with "state"
- the rules inside a state have a ":" and start with <rule number>
